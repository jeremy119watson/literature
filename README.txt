    I used Python for my object-oriented language. These files are found in the "Literature" directory.

            - "app.py" starts up the server, getting everything going. The gui is displayed on "localhost:5000".
    

    I created the gui using HTML, CSS, and JS. 

            - The HTML files are found under "templates" and "templates/includes". These files are rendered as one by the Flask framework I'm using as a server.

            - The CSS files are found under "static/css". I only wrote "style.css", not "w3.css", which is a free CSS library.

            - The JS files are found under "static/js". I only wrote "game.js". I used AngularJS is a way it was probably not meant to be used, but it works so whatever.
    

    Since the gui isn't object-oriented, and is separate from the game logic, it is not commented heavily.
